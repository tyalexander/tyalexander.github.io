  I'm Tyler Alexander. Ever since I was young, I wanted to enter the field of medicine; to me, there is nothing more powerful than the ability to make a positive impact in someone's life â€“ while working with a team of folks oriented around the same goal. I believe in the power of working across disciplines, to facilitate change and foster innovation. I am inspired by "how" and "why" things work; I believe it is essential to understand fundamental workings of processes, if we are to drive progress and create life-altering inventions.
